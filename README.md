# 📊 Customer Segmentation & Insights

# 🏆 Project Overview

This project focuses on Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) to analyze customer purchasing behavior and drive targeted marketing strategies. The analysis helps businesses optimize customer retention and increase revenue by identifying high-value customers and understanding their purchasing patterns.

# 🔍 Key Objectives

✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handle missing values, duplicates, outliers, and standardize formats.

✅ Customer Segmentation – Use RFM Analysis to categorize customers into high-value, mid-tier, and low-value segments.

✅ Insights & Business Recommendations – Develop strategies to improve customer retention and increase engagement.

✅ Visualizations & Reporting – Create Power BI dashboards & charts for easy interpretation of findings.
